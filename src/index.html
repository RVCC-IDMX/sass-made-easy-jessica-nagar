        <h1> The Raven </h1>
        <h2>Edgar Allan Poe</h2>

        <section class="poem">
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</p>
                <p>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,</p>
                <p>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</p>
                <p>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</p>
                <p>"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door,</p>
                <p>Only this, and nothing more."</p>
            </div>

            <hr aria-hidden="true">
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,</p>
                <p>
                    And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</p>
                <p>
                    Eagerly I wished the morrow;, vainly I had sought to borrow</p>
                <p>
                    From my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost Lenore,</p>
                <p>
                    For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,</p>
                <p>
                    Nameless here for evermore.</p>
            </div>

            <hr aria-hidden="true">
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</p>
                <p>
                    Thrilled me, filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</p>
                <p>
                    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,</p>
                <p>
                    "'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,</p>
                <p>
                    Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-</p>
                <p>
                    This it is, and nothing more."</p>
            </div>

            <hr aria-hidden="true">
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</p>
                <p>
                    "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</p>
                <p>
                    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,</p>
                <p>
                    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,</p>
                <p>
                    That I scarce was sure I heard you", here I opened wide the door;-</p>
                <p>
                    Darkness there, and nothing more.</p>
            </div>


            <hr aria-hidden="true">
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</p>
                <p>
                    Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;</p>
                <p>
                    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,</p>
                <p>
                    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"</p>
                <p>
                    This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!",</p>
                <p>
                    Merely this, and nothing more.</p>
            </div>

            <hr aria-hidden="true">
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,</p>
                <p>
                    Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.</p>
                <p>
                    "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice:</p>
                <p>
                    Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore,</p>
                <p>
                    Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;,</p>
                <p>
                    'Tis the wind and nothing more."</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                <hr aria-hidden="true">
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,</p>
                <p>
                    In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;</p>
                <p>
                    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;</p>
                <p>
                    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door,</p>
                <p>
                    Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door,</p>
                <p>
                    Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>
            </div>

            <hr aria-hidden="true">
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,</p>
                <p>
                    By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.</p>
                <p>
                    "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,</p>
                <p>
                    Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore,</p>
                <p>
                    Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"</p>
                <p>
                    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
            </div>

            <hr aria-hidden="true">
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Much I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</p>
                <p>
                    Though its answer little meaning, little relevancy bore;</p>
                <p>
                    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</p>
                <p>
                    Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door,</p>
                <p>
                    Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,</p>
                <p>
                    With such name as "Nevermore."</p>
            </div>

            <hr aria-hidden="true">
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only</p>
                <p>
                    That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</p>
                <p>
                    Nothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered,</p>
                <p>
                    Till I scarcely more than muttered, "other friends have flown before,</p>
                <p>
                    On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."</p>
                <p>
                    Then the bird said, "Nevermore."</p>
            </div>

            <hr aria-hidden="true">
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,</p>
                <p>
                    "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,</p>
                <p>
                    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster</p>
                <p>
                    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore,</p>
                <p>
                    Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore</p>
                <p>
                    Of 'Never, nevermore'."</p>

                <p>But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,</p>
                <p>
                    Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;</p>
                <p>
                    Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking</p>
                <p>
                    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore,</p>
                <p>
                    What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore</p>
            </div>

            <hr aria-hidden="true">
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Meant in croaking "Nevermore."</p>

            <hr aria-hidden="true">
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing</p>
                <p>
                    To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;</p>
                <p>
                    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining</p>
                <p>
                    On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,</p>
                <p>
                    But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,</p>
                <p>
                    She shall press, ah, nevermore!</p>

            <hr aria-hidden="true">
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer</p>
                <p>
                    Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.</p>
                <p>
                    "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee, by these angels he hath sent thee</p>
